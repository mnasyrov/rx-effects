/**
 * A node in the reactive graph.
 *
 * Nodes can be producers of reactive values, consumers of other reactive values, or both.
 *
 * Producers are nodes that produce values, and can be depended upon by consumer nodes.
 *
 * Producers expose a monotonic `valueVersion` counter, and are responsible for incrementing this
 * version when their value semantically changes. Some producers may produce their values lazily and
 * thus at times need to be polled for potential updates to their value (and by extension their
 * `valueVersion`). This is accomplished via the `onProducerUpdateValueVersion` method for
 * implemented by producers, which should perform whatever calculations are necessary to ensure
 * `valueVersion` is up to date.
 *
 * Consumers are nodes that depend on the values of producers and are notified when those values
 * might have changed.
 *
 * Consumers do not wrap the reads they consume themselves, but rather can be set as the active
 * reader via `setActiveConsumer`. Reads of producers that happen while a consumer is active will
 * result in those producers being added as dependencies of that consumer node.
 *
 * The set of dependencies of a consumer is dynamic. Implementers expose a monotonically increasing
 * `trackingVersion` counter, which increments whenever the consumer is about to re-run any reactive
 * reads it needs and establish a new set of dependencies as a result.
 *
 * Producers store the last `trackingVersion` they've seen from `Consumer`s which have read them.
 * This allows a producer to identify whether its record of the dependency is current or stale, by
 * comparing the consumer's `trackingVersion` to the version at which the dependency was
 * last observed.
